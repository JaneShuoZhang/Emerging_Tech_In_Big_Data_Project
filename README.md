# Emerging_Tech_In_Big_Data_Project
Final project for course Emerging Technologies in Big Data

## Social Network: 
We will use Facebook data and use a graph database review how people are related. We will run queries on the average number of friends someone has in other schools, or how students of different demographics or major relate to the amount of friends they have.
We will use spark or some other tool to ETL the data and then read it via a graph database.
